Date: 2024-07-27

**Project Title: Cross-Platform PowerShell Clipboard Saver**

**Project Intention:**
The intention of this project is to create a cross-platform PowerShell script that utilizes the .NET SDK to read the current contents of the clipboard and save them to a file in the appropriate format. The script is designed to handle various types of clipboard content, including text, images, and rich text, and will create files with appropriate extensions and names based on the content type. This utility aims to be simple yet powerful, providing users with an easy way to save clipboard contents while ensuring compatibility with both Windows and Linux systems.

**Project Summary:**
The PowerShell script will read the current clipboard contents, determine the content type, and save the data to a file in the current directory. The file name will include the current date and time in ISO format, a random GUID, and an appropriate extension based on the content type. The script will include detailed logging with ANSI color formatting for better readability and will handle errors gracefully, ensuring users are informed of the script's operations and any issues that arise.

### Outline for PowerShell Script to Save Clipboard Contents to a File

#### 1. **Initialization**
   - 1.1 Load necessary .NET SDK assemblies.
   - 1.2 Initialize variables for logging and error reporting using PowerShell built-in plain text messages with ANSI code formatting.

#### 2. **Reading Clipboard Content**
   - 2.1 Check if the clipboard contains any data.
   - 2.2 Determine the type of content in the clipboard (text, image, rich text, etc.).
   - 2.3 Handle only the most recent item if multiple items are present.

#### 3. **Generating File Name**
   - 3.1 Get the current date and time in ISO format.
   - 3.2 Generate a random GUID.
   - 3.3 Determine the appropriate file extension based on the clipboard content type.
   - 3.4 Construct the file name using the date, GUID, and extension.

#### 4. **Saving Clipboard Content to File**
   - 4.1 For text content:
      - 4.1.1 Retrieve the text from the clipboard.
      - 4.1.2 Write the text to a .txt file.
   - 4.2 For image content:
      - 4.2.1 Retrieve the image from the clipboard.
      - 4.2.2 Save the image as a PNG file.
   - 4.3 For rich text content:
      - 4.3.1 Retrieve the rich text from the clipboard.
      - 4.3.2 Save the rich text to an .rtf or .html file.
   - 4.4 For other content types:
      - 4.4.1 Retrieve the content from the clipboard.
      - 4.4.2 Determine an appropriate file format.
      - 4.4.3 Save the content to the file.

#### 5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - 5.1 Log the start of the operation.
   - 5.2 Log each significant step (clipboard read, file creation, etc.).
   - 5.3 If an error occurs:
      - 5.3.1 Log the error details with ANSI color highlighting for the word "error".
      - 5.3.2 Print debugging information to the console.
      - 5.3.3 Exit the script with a negative exit code.
   - 5.4 If successful:
      - 5.4.1 Log the success message.
      - 5.4.2 Print the resulting file name to the console.
      - 5.4.3 Exit the script with a positive exit code.

#### 6. **Script Termination**
   - 6.1 Ensure all resources are properly released.
   - 6.2 Finalize logging.

### Notes:
- The script will prioritize saving images as PNG and text as TXT.
- For rich content, the script will attempt to save as RTF or HTML, ensuring compatibility with default readers on both Windows and Linux.
- The script will work cross-platform on both PowerShell 5 and the latest PowerShell 7.
- Logging will be done directly to the console with ANSI code formatting for enhanced readability.

If this outline meets your needs, we can proceed to the speedrun phase where we quickly draft the script. Let me know if there are any further adjustments or if weâ€™re ready to move on!



## GPT Implementation

It seems that the script failed to load the necessary .NET assemblies because the `System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard` type was not found. This error can occur if the required assemblies are not present in the environment where the script is being executed.

### Fixes and Improvements:

1. **Assembly Loading Check**:
   - We should ensure that the assemblies are loaded correctly.
   - For cross-platform compatibility, ensure that the script handles the differences between Windows and Linux environments.

2. **Script Execution Context**:
   - Since clipboard operations are typically only available in a desktop environment, we should check and handle cases where the script is run in non-interactive or non-GUI environments.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Implement a fallback or more robust error handling when assemblies are not found.

### Key Changes:

1. **Assembly Loading Check**:
   - Added the `-ErrorAction Stop` parameter to ensure that errors in loading assemblies are caught and handled.
   - Added logging to indicate successful loading of each assembly.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error messages to provide more context.

3. **Cross-Platform Consideration**:
   - The script still assumes that it is running in a Windows environment where clipboard operations are available. For cross-platform support, consider using different clipboard access methods for different environments.

This should address the issue with the assembly not being found and ensure more robust error handling and logging. If there are any further requirements or adjustments needed, please let me know.
